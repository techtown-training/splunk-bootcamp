Time: 30 minutes

## Instructions
It's time to keep practicing. This time, it's your turn to be creative. The idea is that you create searches by using the most common commands. Feel free to add more queries if you finish early.

### Upload data
Let's use some data from FIFA. Upload the file for [soccer rankings](../data/fifa-international-soccer-mens-ranking-1993now.zip).

### Using Search Commands

- 9.1 - What's the __average rank__ number for __Spain__ in __2018__?
- 9.2 - What are the __average rank__ number for __Germany__ or __Italy__ in __2000__?  _Average both numbers together_
- 9.3 - What are the __top five__ __countries__ by number of events in __2014__? _"Events" as in splunk events._  Bonus: Can you find the __top five__ __countries__ by __rank__ in __2014__?
- 9.4 - List the __countries__ with a __new__ __`diff_points` field__ that includes the difference between `total_points` and `previous_points`. _(diff_points = total_points - previous_points) - You will need to use "EVAL" to create the new field._
