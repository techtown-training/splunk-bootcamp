# Drilldown
Time: 15 minutes

## Instructions
A key aspect at debugging time is to be able to go deeper. For example, in a dashboard, you might have the top errors list in a table (built from a custom search). And you might like to click on one of those errors and know more about it. Well, you can configure a drilldown so when you click on an option, it opens a new search, dashboard, or an URL.

### Drilldown With Auto Search
Let's continue using the top URLs list from the previous lab. Even though this might not make sense to include in the dashboard, let's use it for practice purposes. Create a report from the following search query:

```
sourcetype=access_custom | stats count by server_ip | eval label=server_ip." (".count.")"
```

- Add this saved report to the dashboard (use the "Add Panel" button and search for the report you just created)
- In edit mode, click on the additional options button from the table and click on "Drilldown"
- Choose "Link to search" for the click option
- Make sure the "Auto" option is selected
- Click on "Apply"
- Click on "Save"
- Test that it's working by clicking on one of the options. It should open a new search filtering events by the action you selected

### Drilldown With Custom Search
We'll continue using the same search panel you just added.

- In edit mode, click on the additional options button from the table and click on "Drilldown"
- Choose "Link to search" for the click option
- Make sure the "Custom" option is selected
- Type the following search query in the "Search String" box

```
sourcetype=access_custom server_ip=$click.value2$
```

- Click on "Apply"
- Click on "Save"
- Test that it's working by clicking on one of the options. It should open a new search filtering events by the action you selected

### Drilldown to Another Dashboard
Now, let's open the same dashboard. But this time, when you click one action, that action will be preselected in the dropdown input you have. This should change the results on the screen.

- In edit mode, click on the additional options button from the table and click on "Drilldown"
- Choose "Link to dashboard" for the click option
- Choose the dashboard panel you created (the one you're using&mdash;I know, it doesn't make sense, but bear with me)
- Click on the "Advance" link
    - Type "form.actionid" in the first box
    - Type "$click.value2$" in the second box (notice how Splunk lists the posible values you could use here)
- Click on "Apply"
- Click on "Save"
- Test that it's working by clicking on one of the options. It should open a new search filtering events by the action you selected
