# Scheduled Reports
Time: 15 minutes

## Instructions
At this time, you've already created, edited, and saved a few searches. You've also created at least one dashboard panel. Now it's time for you to create a scheduled report for those people that don't have time to see any reports on a daily basis. By using scheduled reports, you can send crucial information to C-level executives only when they need it. Or maybe you'd like to send reports of your system to certain customers.

You can create reports via Splunk Web four ways:

1. From `Search`, by saving a search as a report
2. From `Pivot`, by saving a pivot as a report
3. By navigating to `Settings > Searches`, reports, and alerts, and clicking `New` to add a new report
4. From a dashboard, by converting an inline-search-powered dashboard panel to a report

### Schedule Report From a Saved Search
Choose a saved search you've already created (or create a new one, just to keep practicing). After choosing a saved search, **schedule it as a report that will be sent daily at 6 PM.**

### Schedule Report From a Dashboard
Choose an existing dashboard or create a new one. Then **schedule it as a report that will be sent on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8 AM.**
