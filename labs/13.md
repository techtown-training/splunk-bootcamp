# Alerts
Time: 30 minutes

## Instructions
There will be times when you'll need to get alerts and take action, either for security reasons or because you need to fix something in the system. For this type of thing, Splunk has alerts. And in this lab, you'll create a few of them for practice.

### Create a Scheduled Alert
Let's create an alert that searches for events on a regular schedule. For that, you need to do the following:

- Create or use an existing saved search
- Select `Save As > Alert`
- Type the title of the alert and the description, and specify permissions
- Configure the alert schedule
- Select an action (e.g., email)
- Click on `Save`

It doesn't matter if it's hard to trigger the alarm or the action doesn't work. The purpose of this lab is that you know how to create alerts. Maybe the trigger is complex or the email configuration is missing.

### Create More Alerts
For the following tasks, you'll need to pay close attention to the details in the alerts form to configure the alert properly. Make sure you're configuring the email action in each alert.

- Create a scheduled alert using cron
- Create a real-time triggered by `per-result`
- Create a real-time triggered by a rolling window (e.g., number of hosts or results)
