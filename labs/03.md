# Upload Log Data Manually
Time: 15 minutes

## Instructions
This time, you're going to upload data manually from your local computer. You'll download some example files from Splunk, and then you'll confirm that the data has been uploaded by doing a simple search.

### Add Data Manually
Let's start by downloading the data, but don't uncompress it. You'll upload public data for consumer and visitior insights for neighborhoods from the Census Block Group.

```
A Census Block Group (CBG) is the most granular level the US Census Bureau reports data on, and covers ~1500 households.

SafeGraph derived the popularity of a CBG or distances traveled to a CBG by analyzing a large panel of GPS movement data.

We also combined this GPS data with our dataset of 5 million building footprints for Points-of-Interest in the U.S. (SafeGraph Places) to determine visits to places like stores or restaurants. We used these visit counts to derive consumer insights such as top brands (ex. McDonald's) visited in a CBG.
