# Create Your First Index
Time: 15 minutes

## Instructions
The purpose of this lab is to create an index manually. After that, you'll upload data to the index manually.

### Create an Index
Let's create your first index using the Splunk UI. Try not to simply follow these steps; take a moment to review each field in the form, and ask questions if something is not clear.

- Go to "Settings"
- In the Data section, click on "Indexes"
- Click on the "New Index" button 
- Set the name as ”winlogs”
- Change the max size to 100 and choose the MB option
- Change to MB option the ”Max size of Hot/Warm/Cold Bucket”
- Choose the “Destinations” app
- Click on “Save”

### Manually Upload a Single File Data
Let's manually upload data into the new index. You'd try to avoid adding events this way, but there are times when you might need to understand first how Splunk understands a file or what you can you do with the data indexed.

- Go to "Settings"
- Under the Data section, click on "Data inputs"
- On the Data inputs page, click on "Files & Directories"
- In the next page, click on the "New button"
- Locate the `/opt/splunk/etc/apps/destinations/samples/windows_perfmon_logs.txt` file
- Check the "Continuously Monitor" option
- Click on "Next" (under the nav menu) to advance to the set source type screen
- Click on "Save As" to enter the custom sourcetype as `myperfmon`, and "Save" it
- Click on "Next" to proceed 
- In the input settings window, ensure that the app context is "Destinations (destinations)" and set the index for this data input to the winlogs index
- Click on the “Review” button 
- Click on “Submit”
- Click on the “Start Searching” button
